# iOS-Term-3-Portfolio
Introduction My name is Aditya Nandhiyar and I am a senior at Eden Prairie High School. This was the first time I learned Swift especially in a class that is governed by your success.  The apps that I have made in this class so far are not perfect nor finished, but I learned something new through each topic or youtube video I watched that has helped me on the way. Taking this iOS class after taking AP Computer Science Principles and AP Java has shown me a more artistic side of coding regarding UI and even coding itself. Projects Currently, I am working on finishing up an app called BlackJack 2020 which is essentially just the game blackjack itself within an app. There is also a betting option in terms of how much money a person can bet during each hand played. The AI would be the dealer who plays like an actual dealer in a casino which abides by the casino rules. I am struggling a little bit with the betting aspect in terms of gains and losses. Interests I am interested in more of the design aspect than coding as Swift isn't one of my strong suits in the programming world. I plan to learn sprites and animations, especially in character creation.
